Thanks to Alex "eevee" Munroe at http://veekun.com/
for his SQLite Pokedex database, which powers this software.

"veekun-pokedex.sqlite" was built from his database.

Thanks to the fine folks at SQLite.org for making it possible
to use the Pokedex database... the source files "sqlite3.c"
and "sqlite3.h" came from these people.

Thanks to those of Project Pokemon (http://projectpokemon.org/)
who have helped research and document the underlying structure
of Pokemon game save files.

Thanks to Nicholas Corgan (https://github.com/ncorgan) for contributing
directly to this project's code, making it more portable.

Thanks to the folks at Smogon for the stat formula and other things.

Special thanks to SCV, Sabresite, loadingNOW, Poryhack,
GatorShark, Chase, Jiggy-Ninja, Codr, Bond697, mingot, Guested,
